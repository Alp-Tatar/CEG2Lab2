# CEG3136 – Lab2: Simple State Machine (C)

## Introduction
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the completion of Lab2 in CEG3136. In this lab assignment, I have successfully implemented a state machine to control a vehicle's automatic transmission system. The system is designed to automatically shift gears based on the vehicle's RPM to achieve maximum efficiency.

## Overview
- **Objective:** Implement a state machine for controlling a vehicle's automatic transmission system.
- **Language Used:** C
- **Lab Completion Date:** [Insert Completion Date]

## Lab Completion Summary
- **Implemented Features:**
  - Implemented a state machine to control the automatic transmission system.
  - Utilized object-oriented programming concepts to design the system.
  - Integrated interrupt-based application architecture.
- **Tested Functionality:**
  - Tested the system using stimulus generators to simulate vehicle speed and driving shifts.
  - Verified the proper functioning of the automatic transmission system by observing gear shifts based on RPM.

## Project Structure
- **Source Code:** The C source code files for the automatic transmission system implementation.
- **µVision Project:** The µVision project containing all project files and configurations.

## Instructions for Running the Project
1. Download the provided µVision project.
2. Compile and run the project code.
3. Ensure proper functionality by observing gear shifts based on simulated vehicle speed.
4. Use the logic analyzer feature to observe variable changes during simulation.
5. Take a snapshot of the logic analyzer plot for documentation.
